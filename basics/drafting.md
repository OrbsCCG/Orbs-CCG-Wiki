# Drafting

Drafted decks are decks made up of cards that you select from a limited pool. In drafting, you are presented with a series of booster packs, each containing 15 cards. You select a card you want, take it, and add it to your collection, then pass the booster pack onward. At the end of the draft, you can use the cards in your draft pool to build a deck. Drafting is a great way to test your card evaluation and deck building skills.

## Building Your Draft Deck

After the draft is over, you will be able to build a deck from the cards in your draft pool. You will need to build a deck with exactly 40 cards. If you did not draft enough cards, you can fill up your deck with Empty Vessel cards, which will be provided to you in the deck editor.

## Playing With Your Draft Deck

After you have built your deck, you can play with it against other drafted decks. You can play up to 8 games with your draft deck. After you have played 8 games, your draft deck will be retired.

## Reward Structure

In this alpha version of the game, we're letting players draft for free with no rewards, but this will change when we get closer to the release.

## Auction Drafts

Auction drafting is a variant of drafting where players bid on cards to add to their draft pool. In an auction draft, players start with 800 chips, which are the currency used to bid on cards. Booster packs are then opened one at a time, and all players see the contents of the same booster pack at once. Players place their bids simultaneously for each card. The highest bid wins, but only pays the second-highest bid. If there is a tie, the winner is randomly selected from the highest bidders. You may win more than one card from a single booster pack.

This form of auction drafting is known as a "Vickrey auction" and gives rise to "Vickrey's truth serum," a mathematical property that means it is always in your best interest to bid your true valuation of a card. It is impossible to try to outsmart the bids by bidding more or less than your true valuation, as you will always pay the second-highest bid. So rest assured, all you have to think about is: how much is this card worth to my deck? The answer is your bid.

Auction drafting is not something that will always be available, but may show up from time to time as a special event.
